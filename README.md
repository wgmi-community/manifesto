### Manifesto

We're putting the WE in web3.

Building Communities online was destined since the invention of the computer, internet and web. As we enter this new epoch of web3 and onward, we (as an industry) are in dire need of Community professionals who can lead these online coordination around web3 projects, products, tools, platforms, developer environments, protocols, tokens—you name it.

**We're on a mission to bring more Community builders to web3.**

It's difficult to find seasoned, talented, holistic (knowlegable of web3 primitives and Community strategies), and committed individuals to manage your web3 or Ethereum projects. Web3 projects are dying to onboard the right candidates, and future Community Managers are just now discovering that this is a career path...Wgmi is looking to close that gap for the Ethereum ecosystem.

**Enter Wgmi: a Service DAO for Community builder services**

Being vital to the success of web3 projects, there is a huge demand online for Community Moderators, Community Managers, Community Directors, Community Leads or more technical positions like Developer Evangelists, Developer Advocates.

**This community was built for educating up and coming community professionals and leaders in the web3 space. To meet this talent gap in our current state—our aim is to:** 
  
- Deploy a Service DAO model that supports Ethereum projects that need Community Manager support
    - e.g. protocols, applications, dev tooling, DAOs, NFTs, DeFi, Metaverse
- Open source resources, standards, models, and tools that will onboard the next generation of Community-first projects
- Design bootcamps, workshops, and apprentice programs that help grow the Community Builder talent pool in web3

## We believe community professionals are the role of the future.

In web3, there is a huge demand online for Community Moderators, Community Managers, Community Directors, Community Leads or more technical positions like Developer Evangelists, Developer Advocates. Being a vital aspect to the success of web3 projects, community roles are a growing trend.

Through Wgmi—we’re assembling the brightest minds from web2 to web3 that have built online communities to… open source this knowledge and onboard the next generation of Community professionals. By sharing resources, experiences, tools, processes, and evangelizing newcomers to roll up their sleeves—we can create a factory of leaders that will be guiding the next generation of developments on Ethereum with respect to DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and more.

## What’s worse than Moloch? The Machine.

Moloch, the demon of coordination failure, is the bane of DAOs existence. To make it worse, as online Communities, we’re destined to fall into many more problems; including the soulless, dystopian, machine-owned, bot-controlled, Discord hosted future. All of us, programmed to talk to one another, unaware of who is real, who is a bot...none of us unique in our ideas, mere calculations and automations rather than understanding, compassion, feeling. Communities are our strength. They’re what make what we do...human.

In web2 there are quite a few community managers, directors, leaders, advocates, ambassadors… but we have yet to bridge them over to web3 where their skills are highly demanded. In web3, there are some additional learnings such as using Chat (e.g. Discord, Telegram), Social Media (e.g. Twitter), Wallets (e.g. Metamask) and various tokens (e.g. erc-721s/NFTs, erc-20s, L2s, testnets, sidechains on Ethereum) as gated experiences. There is also the knowledge-base of the NFT, DeFi, protocol layer and various other complexities to the blockchain, web3, Ethereum ecosystem that we as community folks need to unbundle.

The way we see it, our perfect world will be a collection of Communities empowered by a relationship with automations, bots, tools, code. Not the other way around.

Both coordination and efficiency failures remains the looming demon that prevents DAOs and communities from achieving a common goal. Wgmi stands tall, facing both Moloch and and the Machine with clenched fists... 

Our role as Community Professionals is to be the nervous system of the Community. To feel what members, contributors, developers, and stakeholders hold close. To communicate those feelings, inform, educate, and solve issues that the entire organism should embody.

## Our Culture…

**Community first** — attributed to Metacartel’s Community-First Manifesto, we’re focused on what brings value back to our immediate community and the wider Ethereum ecosystem at large. We care more about making impact over time versus creating fomo around prospective monetary value of "community".

**Radical transparency** — There is no “us” and “them” in Community. There is only the monster of coordination that we are all fighting over—in web3 we call this “moloch”. Web3 culture is about building in public, transparent governance, and deploying in open source. The success of the community is how efficiently we can deploy work, and how engaged we can bring in the wider community.

**Collaboration** — The internet sure did not build itself. There is also not one founder of the web, of blockchain, of Etheruem. There are thousands of engineers, contributors, inventors, creators, and entrepreneurs that made the access to connectivity what it is today. We believe heavily in leveraging everyone’s skills to achieve a common goal.

**Contribution** — We believe in solving problems, fixing issues and participating for the sake of Community. Our members willingly contribute code, content, communication, and effort to help the greater cause. There is the understanding that work = incentives and recognition based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, however, to gain the community’s trust, value is interpreted as how much you contribute to the whole before you're to expect anything in return. This is our culture; we give more than we take.

## The vision ahead…

We’re focused on being a service provider for web3 Community Development, Strategy, and Coordination.

Currently, Wgmi DAO is providing Community development and management services for Ethereum compatible web3 projects or DAOs.

As we grow and as Ethereum scales, we will be allocating time and resources to onboarding the next generation of web3 Community Professionals.

To convert them from web3 newbies and/or Community amateurs, our goal is to educate and open source Community Management best practices.

Over time— Wgmi DAO will be an organism that creates a funnel for prospective Community talent in the ecosystem…prepares them to manage Communities themselves… and ultimately curates work for them as bounties governed by the DAO.

Our focus is around setting standards and common practices between Community professionals, to fill the talent gap, and make sure every project in web3 is able to execute on a Community-first mindset.

**Join us on our mission to bring more Community Builders to web3!**
